# Palindrome Stack

Palindrome Stack is a Rust library that provides a stack data structure that only accepts palindromes. The library is useful when working with collections of palindromes and simplifies the process of adding and removing items while maintaining the palindrome constraint.

## Features

- A stack data structure implementation with a custom `push_palindrome` method that only pushes items onto the stack if they are palindromes.
- Implements the basic stack operations like `pop` and `is_empty`.
- Provides a Debug implementation for the stack, allowing it to be easily printed.
